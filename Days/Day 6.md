# Day 6 – 10-24-2025

## 🕐 08:35 AM - Learning Session
**Platform:** Code-Basics.com

**What I Learned:**
- Logic type
- Combining Operations and Functions
- Logical operators
- Negation
- The result of logical expressions

**Notes:**
> [First Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/bool_type.py) `Write a function is_pensioner() that takes someone's age as a single argument and checks whether that person is at retirement age. For the purposes of this exercise, retirement age is considered to be 60 years or over.` Forgot to do the type annotations

> [Second Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/logic_combine_expression.py) `Implement a function called is_international_phone() function that checks the format of a given phone number. If the phone number starts with +, then it's in the international format.` Should've returned without storing the variable, makes the code simpler and shorter.

> [Third Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/logical_operators.py) `Implement a method is_leap_year() that determines whether a year is a leap year or not. A year will be a leap year if it is a multiple of 400 (i.e. divisible without a remainder), or if it is both a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100.` Got it first try! Unnecessary brackets though.

> [Fourth Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/logical_negation.py) `1. Implement a function called is_palindrome() that determines whether a word is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word that reads the same way in both directions. Words may be passed to the function in any case, so you must first convert the word to lowercase: word.lower(). 2. Implement a function called is_not_palindrome() which checks if a word is NOT a palindrome` Tests on the site were a little off, but it's basically the right code.

> [Fifth Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/logical_expressions.py) `Implement a function string_or_not() that checks if the passed parameter is a string. If yes, it returns 'yes' otherwise 'no'.`
