**Notes:**

- Welcome back! Well, to me lol. Will get right back on track with Part 12 of the course...

- Got perfect on the first quiz, the lose streak is now broken hehe. Onto Part 13 of the lesson!

- Quick note before I start the video, A DRAG PATH ETCHED IN THE SURFACE AS EVIDENCE, I LEFT THERE ON PURPOSE. A SAD SACK. Song's been stuck on my mind, listening to it while watching the video. But that's not what I wanna talk about, The other parts of the video are not part of the main fundamentals, so I will be skipping those. Part 13 is also the Summary Video for all the things discussed, so it's a bit longer than the other videos.

- Got two wrong on the final quiz, thought I was gonna have a flawless streak starting smh RAAAHHH. That's a new record for two mistakes, shit.  But I'm finally done with the Networking Fundamentals HELL YEAH!!. Tomorrow, I move on to the next phase of the roadmap, so excited! Goodbyee!

## 📅 Day 21 - 11/30/2025

### 🕤 09:20 PM - Security

**Platform:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Heuristica](https://www.heuristi.ca/tools/free-ai-quiz-generator)

**What I Learned:**

- Threats
- Risks
- Vulnerabilities

**Notes:**

- Hi! Couldn't resume learning the past 2 days cause I attended an event on the 28th and spent 29th readjusting my sleep schedule 'cause waking up early on the 28th fucked it up lol. But no worries, it's currently the 30th and my day off, so more learning today and tomorrow!

- Since I'm done with the previous step of the roadmap, I am now moving on to the next step which is `Security foundations: threat vs vulnerability, risk concepts`. Began searching for free resources online and found videos on YouTube about the topic. Will start with this one titled [What Are Threats, Risks, & Vulnerabilities in Cybersecurity? | Google Cybersecurity Certificate](https://youtu.be/qjmDDGaGmys). Will be using [Heuristica](https://www.heuristi.ca/tools/free-ai-quiz-generator) again for the quizzes.

- I don't like Google's video and feel like I only learned so little, but still I'll be taking the quiz and see if I learned something LOL.

- Surprisingly, I only got one question wrong in the quiz. Will be moving to another video titled [What is Vulnerability, Threat and Risk? | Difference between Vulnerability,Threat and Risk Explained](https://youtu.be/WCfvF457N4I). I got the gist of this step of the roadmap, but will be watching one more just to be sure

- Wow, the video is simple and straight to the point. Took the test and still got one wrong, smh. And I think that's all for this step of the roadmap. That was fast! Also, that marks the end for this session, will be taking a break and continuing this later on within the day. Bye!

## 📅 Day 22 - 12/01/2025

### 🕣 08:38 PM - WireShark

**Platform:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTaOZrDnMzQ), [Heuristica](https://www.heuristi.ca/tools/free-ai-quiz-generator)

**What I Learned:**

- Wireshark Fundamentals
- Filtering Packets
- Network Scanning
- HTTP and HTTPS Ports

**Notes:**

- SO, I lied about taking a break and ended up oversleeping, I am getting lazy, nooo! But anyways, I am at the next step of the roadmap which is `Hands-on tools: Nmap, Wireshark, basic scans`. First off I'll be watching YouTube videos on the topic, then I will test myself on the actual virtual machines/labs.

- First video I'm watching is titled [Wireshark Tutorial for Beginners | Network Scanning Made Easy](https://youtu.be/qTaOZrDnMzQ). Then again, I'll be using [Heuristica](https://www.heuristi.ca/tools/free-ai-quiz-generator) for a small quiz after every video (goated free tool).

- Gonna boot up Linux VMWare and try out some stuff in WireShark while watching the lesson. The video mentioned this site called [Malware Traffic Analysis](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/) for practice. So, I'm just gonna leave this one here for future me.

- HOLY!! I got a perfect score on the quiz for the first video. I am so good mwehehehehe... Next video is titled [Nmap Tutorial to find Network Vulnerabilities](https://youtu.be/4t4kBkMsDbQ). Which I'll watch after a break, since it's been almost an hour already. CYA LATER!

### 🕜 01:27 AM - NMAP

**Platforms:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTaOZrDnMzQ), [Heuristica](https://www.heuristi.ca/tools/free-ai-quiz-generator)

**What I Learned:**

- Nmap Port Scanning

- Nmap Stealth Mode
- Analyzing with WireShark
- Detect Operating Systems
- Aggressive Mode
- Using a Decoy
- Using Nmap scripts

**Notes:**

- And I'm back, got bored with nothing to do and decided to resume the session. Will watch the next video titled [Nmap Tutorial to find Network Vulnerabilities](https://youtu.be/4t4kBkMsDbQ).

- Will also be opening my own Linux VMWare to test the stuff out while watching the video.

- Tested it within my home network by the way, so no sketchy stuff going on here 👀. Done with the video and will take the quiz!

- Got two wrong! Also, I forgot to mention I only generate 9 questions for each video, would go for 10, but somehow Heurestica doesn't have 10 questions. So, I got 8/10 for this video.

- So, gonna take a break for now. Later, I will be watching one or two more videos, I think... byeee!
