## 🕐 09:20 PM - Python
**Platform:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp)

**What I Learned:**
- Python FIle Handling
- Python Read FIles
- Python Write/Create Files
- Python Delete Files

**Notes:**
> Python basics done, will learn File I/O from W3 Schools.

> All done! Gonna create small projects now with the help of GPT suggesting them.

> [Text File Statistics](..//Python%20Basic%20Project/Text%20File%20Statistics/text_stats.py)
> ```text
> “Text File Statistics” Script
>
> What it does:
> 
> Read a text file (say sample.txt)
> 
> Count number of lines, number of words, number of characters
> 
> Find the longest word or average word length
> 
> Write a short summary into another file (summary.txt)
>```

> Above is the suggested GPT project.

> Holy hell this took a while but I did it! Feels so good, it may not be a clean/optimized code but hey it works!

## 🕐 09:13 AM - Python
**Notes:**
> Second project I chose from GPT:
> ```
> “File-based To-Do / Task Manager CLI”
>
> What it does:
>
> Maintains a file todo.txt, each line is a task.
>
> Script allows user to:
>
> Add a task
>
> List tasks with numbering
>
> Mark a task as done (for simplicity: remove or annotate)
>
> Write changes back to file.
>```

> Made some progress, but the code is still not done. WIll continue tomorrow.
