# Day 14 - 11-20-2025
## 🕐 08:01 AM - Linux

**Platform:**
**[OffSec](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-103-16306/overview)**,
**[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals)**

**What I Learned:**
- A Bit of Background in Linux
- Interacting With My First Linux Machine
- Running First Few Commands
- Interacting With the Filesystem
- Searching for Files
- Introduction to Shell Operators

**Notes:**
> Decided to skip the "About Kali Linux" section, since I don't think it correlates with the Lesson too much besides giving a history lesson about Kali.

> Checked the other sections, I think I chose the wrong platform for learning, what I need to find is a guide on Linux Commands.

> Gonna try this one from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals). Hell yeah! This is awesome, interactive and fun.

> Done with Linux Fundamentals Part 1, aanddd Part 2 is blocked by a paywall... Just as I found a good Website smh. i'll consider paying for a premium subscription in TryHackMe since it IS a good site. But this is supposed to be a completely free learning journey, so I'll stop here for now then continue tomorrow, i'll find an alternative! BYE!

# Day 15 - 11-21-2025
## 🕐 07:17 AM - Linux

**Platform:** [Terminal Quest](https://grawesoft.org/terminal-quest)

**What I Learned:**
- Basic Navigation
- File Operation
- Permissions
- Process Management
- Network Commands
- System Information

**Notes:**
> Found this one site called [Terminal Quest](https://grawesoft.org/terminal-quest), will try it out but it's looking good so far.

> Some exercises require specific solutions that I do not have an idea of, unless I type a wrong command and it shows a hint for the exercise. Hopefully this isn't a common occurrence.

> Soo, it is a common occurence which is annoying, but it's okay, all good! Will just have to search what stuff I haven't learned yet.

> All done with the basic stuff! And I think I completed this step of the roadmap, so I'm learning the next step tomorrow. That's all for this day

**Platform:** [Practical Networking](https://www.practicalnetworking.net/index/networking-fundamentals-how-data-moves-through-the-internet/), [Heuristica](https://www.heuristi.ca/tools/free-ai-quiz-generator)

**Notes:**
> A day has passed, didn't learn yesterday 'cause I was editing some other stuff, but I am back! Will start searching for free courses to learn from...

> I found [this site](https://www.practicalnetworking.net/index/networking-fundamentals-how-data-moves-through-the-internet/), will try it out. Turns out it is a collection of videos, will be watching it on my phone 'cause of the screen issue of the laptop (I switched back to using the laptop screen, connecting it to the phone is too much of a hassle)

> Will also be using Heuristica's [Free AI Quiz Generator](https://www.heuristi.ca/tools/free-ai-quiz-generator) to generate quizzes from the YouTube videos.

> Got one wrong for the quiz for the first video :( But we continue on to the second video. Got a perfect score for the second video's quiz, YEHEY! There's still a lot more videos to go through, but I'll stop here today. Tomorrow is my day off, so I will be learning more tomorrow and the day after that.
