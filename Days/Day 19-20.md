**Notes:**

- Welcome back! Well, to me lol. Will get right back on track with Part 12 of the course...

- Got perfect on the first quiz, the lose streak is now broken hehe. Onto Part 13 of the lesson!

- Quick note before I start the video, A DRAG PATH ETCHED IN THE SURFACE AS EVIDENCE, I LEFT THERE ON PURPOSE. A SAD SACK. Song's been stuck on my mind, listening to it while watching the video. But that's not what I wanna talk about, The other parts of the video are not part of the main fundamentals, so I will be skipping those. Part 13 is also the Summary Video for all the things discussed, so it's a bit longer than the other videos.

- Got two wrong on the final quiz, thought I was gonna have a flawless streak starting smh RAAAHHH. That's a new record for two mistakes, shit.  But I'm finally done with the Networking Fundamentals HELL YEAH!!. Tomorrow, I move on to the next phase of the roadmap, so excited! Goodbyee!
