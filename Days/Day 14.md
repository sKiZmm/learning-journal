# Day 14 - 11-20-2025
## 🕐 08:01 AM - Linux

**Platform:**
**[OffSec](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-103-16306/overview)**,
**[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals)**

**What I Learned:**
- A Bit of Background in Linux
- Interacting With My First Linux Machine
- Running First Few Commands
- Interacting With the Filesystem
- Searching for Files
- Introduction to Shell Operators

**Notes:**
> Decided to skip the "About Kali Linux" section, since I don't think it correlates with the Lesson too much besides giving a history lesson about Kali.

> Checked the other sections, I think I chose the wrong platform for learning, what I need to find is a guide on Linux Commands.

> Gonna try this one from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/module/linux-fundamentals). Hell yeah! This is awesome, interactive and fun.

> Done with Linux Fundamentals Part 1, aanddd Part 2 is blocked by a paywall... Just as I found a good Website smh. i'll consider paying for a premium subscription in TryHackMe since it IS a good site. But this is supposed to be a completely free learning journey, so I'll stop here for now then continue tomorrow, i'll find an alternative! BYE!
