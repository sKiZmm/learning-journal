**Notes:**

- Good Morning! Day 23 and almost a month now, will get right back on track with the next video titled [Penetration Testing with Nmap: A Comprehensive Tutorial](https://youtu.be/wlqUO09J-nw). As usual, VMware open and Heurestica after the video for the quizzes.

- That is one long video, even longer cause I was waiting for the scans to finish on my own VMWare. I doubt Heurestica can generate good questions from this video, since the content was more visual rather than auditory, but will still give it a try

- To my surprise, it actually generated great questionsm, but I still got 8/9 on the quiz. Also, that will be the end of the day, I still have one more video in store for this step of the roadmap, which I will be watching tomorrow. Getting closer and closer to my goal, so excited! BYEBYE!
