# Day 7 – 10-24-2025

## 🕐 08:11 AM - Python
**Platform:** [Code Basics](https://code-basics.com/)

**What I Learned:**
- Conditional Constructions (if)
- else
- The construct else + if = elif

**Notes:**
> Officially 1 week! Proud of myself for continuing, I'm a lazy person lol.

> [First Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/if.py) `Implement a function called guess_number() that takes a number and checks if the number is equal to a given number (let's say 42). If it's equal, the function should return the string 'You win!', otherwise it should return the string 'Try again!'.`

> [Second Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/if_else.py) `Implement a function called normalize_url() function, which normalizes data. It takes a site address and returns it with https:// at the beginning.` I made mine horribly wrong, this made my brain go boom for a while. Didn't know if-else in python is different, my bad. [Rewrote it!](../CodeBasics%20Tests/if_else%20(2).py)

> [Third Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/else_if.py) `The electronic map of Westeros that Sam implemented shows Stark allies in green circles, enemies in red, and neutral families in gray. Write a function who_is_this_house_to_starks() for Sam that takes the family name as input and returns one of three values: 'friend', 'enemy', 'neutral'.` This fucked with my brain, had to rely on ChatGPT which sucks btw. Will do better next time...
