# Day 8 – 10-25-2025

## 🕐 10:29 PM - Python
**Platform:** [Code Basics](https://code-basics.com/)

**What I Learned:**
- Ternary operator
- Match Operator
- While Loop
- Data Aggregation (Numbers)
- Data Aggregation (Strings)
- Traversing Strings

**Notes:**
> [First Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/ternary_operator.py) `Implement a function flip_flop() that takes a string as input and, if that string is 'flip', returns the string 'flop'. Otherwise, the function should return 'flip'.` Easier than the previous ones.

> [Second Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/match.py) `Implement the function get_number_explanation(), which takes a number as input and returns an explanation for that number. If there is no explanation for the number, return just a number. Explanations are available only for the following numbers:`

> [Third Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/while.py) `Modify the function print_reversed_numbers() so that it prints the numbers in reverse order. To do this, go from the upper bound to the lower bound. In other words, you should initialize the counter with the maximum value, and in the loop body, you should iterate it backwards down to the lower limit.` Accidentally created an infinite loop lol.

> [Fourth Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/aggregation_numbers.py) `Implement a function called multiply_numbers_from_range() that multiplies numbers in a specified range, including range boundaries.` Exact same as the teacher's solution, except the variables of course. Pretty nice!

> [Fifth Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/aggregation_strings.py) `Implement a function called join_numbers_from_range() that combines all the numbers from a range into a string` Continuous code with no errors, got it in first try! Quite the achievement, good work me.

> [Sixth Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/iteration_over_string.py) `Implement a function called print_reversed_word_by_symbol() that prints a word passed to it character by character, as in the example from the theory, but in reverse order.` Code works, but the test on site is different.

> [Alternative Sixth Test:](../CodeBasics%20Tests/iteration_over_string_alt.py) `Based on the tests, I'm supposed to add spaces to the word, so lets do it!` This took a while but I got it!
