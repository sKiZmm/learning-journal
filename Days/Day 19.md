> Okay, another day, another lesson. Will go straight to Part 10 / 15 of the video lesson.
> Finished with the 10th video, was not reading properly and got 1 question wrong, oops! Got all other questions right though, onto Part 11!
> Done with the 11th video, got another one wrong fffuccckkk... I need to be better next time.
