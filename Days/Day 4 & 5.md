# Day 4 – 10-22-2025

## 🕐 07:50 AM - Learning Session
**Platform:** Code-Basics.com

**What I Learned:**
- Named Arguments
- Type Annotations
- 

**Overview:**
> First test:
    `Instructions: Implement a function trim_and_repeat() that takes three parameters: the string, offset - the number of characters by which to trim the string to the left and repetitions - the number of times it needs to be repeated, and returns the resulting string. The default number of characters to cut is 0, and the number of repetitions is 1.`
        [Complete!](..//CodeBasics%20Tests/named_arguments.py) (Code is longer than the teacher's solution. Will try to make next tests simpler)

>Second Test:
    `Implement a function, word_multiply(). It should accept two parameters: A word, A number representing how many times to repeat the word`
        [Test here](..//CodeBasics%20Tests/type_annotations.py) (Closer to the solution! Maybe even better? XD)

## 🕐08:16 AM - Power Lost
> Lost power in the house, which means no internet, which means no learning for now :(

> Power went back up when I was sleeping, onto the next day.
