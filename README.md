# Learning Roadmap Tracker

## 📘 Overview  
This project helps me monitor and organise my learning progress. It is designed especially for coding, cybersecurity, and development skills as I follow my personal roadmap.

## ✅ Purpose  
- Provide a structured way to see what phases I’m working on and what’s next.  
- Help maintain consistency, track tasks, mark things as “In Progress” or “Done”.  
- Serve as a tool to reflect on what I’ve learned and plan the next steps.

## 🧭 Roadmap Summary  
| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 0 | Setup & Mindset: environment, version control, communities |
| Phase 1 | Fundamentals: Python basics, OS & networking foundations |
| Phase 2 | Security Basics: security concepts, tools, beginner labs |
| Phase 3 | Intermediate Skills & Certification: build portfolio, prepare cert |
| Phase 4 | Entry-Level Job & Real-World Experience: apply for SOC roles, learn workflows |
| Phase 5 | Specialisation & Leadership: choose a niche (e.g., pentesting, incident response), advanced certs |
