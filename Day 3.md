**Platform:** Code-Basics.com

**What I Learned:**

**Overview:**
> Weekdays starting, which means work is starting. Have less time to study now, but will try for at least an hour or two everyday.

> First lesson for today went from 0-100 in terms of difficulty, but will try to do it without help. `https://code-basics.com/languages/python/lessons/default-parameters` [Got it](CodeBasics%20Tests/default_parameters.py) Spent the rest of the time learning "git" commands, had a lot of errors updating the git page, made a lot of typo in the files :3 It's hard to keep looking up and down when typing XD. I made another one, oops. Should be all good now.
