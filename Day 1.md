# Day 1 – 2025-10-19

## 🕐 1:04 AM – Learning Session  
**Platform:** LearnPython.org  
**What I learned:**  
- Hello, World!  
- Variables and Types  
- Lists  
- Basic Operators  
- String Formatting  
- Basic String Operations – *frustrating exercise*  

**Overall thoughts:**  
> LearnPython.org was frustrating. The explanations weren’t detailed enough for beginners, and some exercises required a specific phrase to pass even though I met all conditions. They didn’t give hints about the required phrase. I’m thinking of switching to another site for learning.

## 🕓 7:24 AM - Resume Learning
**Platform:** Code-Basics.com

**What I Learned:**
- Arithmetic operations
- Operators
- Commutative operation
- Composition of operations
- Priority
- Floating point numbers
- Linter
- What is a variable
- Changing variables
- Choosing a variable's name
- Expressions in definitions

**Notes:**
> 'Think of a name for the variable that will store "the number of the king's siblings". Write it down in a notebook or email it to yourself. Don't put anything in there except the name of the variable. And in a few lessons, we'll come back to this topic.'

- 'kingSibs' (Following a naming method I learned in HTML a while back.)

**Overview:**
> Recapped some of math lessons from school, which is good for refreshing the rules of calculating. Most of my codes are similar to the teacher's and is a good sign that I am doing things correctly. Explanations are very detailed and it says every possible error and what's causing it. Decided to keep learning for 1 hour then a break to not get overwhelmed and tired.
