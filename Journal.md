# Day 1 – 2025-10-19

## 🕐 1:04 AM – Learning Session  
**Platform:** LearnPython.org  
**What I learned:**  
- Hello, World!  
- Variables and Types  
- Lists  
- Basic Operators  
- String Formatting  
- Basic String Operations – *frustrating exercise*  

**Overall thoughts:**  
> LearnPython.org was frustrating. The explanations weren’t detailed enough for beginners, and some exercises required a specific phrase to pass even though I met all conditions. They didn’t give hints about the required phrase. I’m thinking of switching to another site for learning.
