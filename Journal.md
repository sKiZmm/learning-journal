## **Day 1 - 10/19/25**

1:04 AM:
LearnPython.org

What I learned:  
    Hello, World!  
    Variables and Types  
    Lists  
    Basic Operators  
    String Formatting  
    Basic String Operations: frustrating exercise

Overall:  
    LearnPython.org sucks, the explanations are not detailed enough to understand for beginners, and some of the exercise require a specific phrase to pass, even though all the conditions are achieved. They do not give out hints for the phrase or some shit. Thinking of finding another site to learn from.
